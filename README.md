# TixGo Project

## Overview
TixGo is a backend project designed to help developers master Go (Golang) best practices, scalable backend architecture, and modern DevOps workflows. The project is structured in progressive phases, each focusing on a core area of software engineering, from clean code to production-ready deployment and system design.

## Project Roadmap

### üß± Phase 1: Strengthen Technical Foundation
**Goal:** Write readable, maintainable, and scalable Go code.

**Key Skills:**
- Clean Code in Go: naming, package structure, function design
- SOLID principles, KISS, DRY
- Common Go design patterns: Factory, Strategy, Adapter, etc.
- Layered or DDD project structure
- Unit and integration testing
- Standardized logging and error handling

**Recommended Resources:**
- "Clean Code" ‚Äì Robert C. Martin
- Go With The Domain (DDD + Go)
- Go Patterns

---

### üöÄ Phase 2: Master Backend Architecture
**Goal:** Understand and optimize backend architecture, modularization, and scalable API design.

**Key Skills:**
- Monolith vs Microservices
- RESTful API & gRPC best practices
- Event-driven architecture (Pub/Sub, Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Caching strategies (Redis, TTL, local cache)
- Database optimization: indexing, normalization, query profiling
- Go concurrency patterns: worker pool, channel, context

**Recommended Resources:**
- Golang Concurrency Patterns ‚Äì Rob Pike (video)
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications ‚Äì Martin Kleppmann
- OSS Go Repos: Thanos, Temporal

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 3: DevOps & CI/CD
**Goal:** Build, deploy, and monitor a production-ready system.

**Key Skills:**
- Dockerizing Go applications
- Writing Dockerfile, docker-compose, using multi-stage builds
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- Basic Kubernetes (deploy, service, ingress)
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana, Jaeger, ELK Stack

**Recommended Resources:**
- Learn Docker by Building a Microservice with Golang
- Awesome CI/CD
- Kubernetes in Action ‚Äì Manning

---

### üß† Phase 4: Software Architecture & System Design
**Goal:** Design large-scale systems, make architectural trade-offs, and document design decisions.

**Key Skills:**
- High-level architecture design (Component, Sequence diagrams)
- Choosing the right architecture: Hexagonal, Clean, Onion
- Trade-offs: availability, consistency, scalability, latency
- Writing Architectural Decision Records (ADR)
- Security: OWASP Top 10, AuthN/AuthZ, TLS, JWT, OAuth2

**Recommended Resources:**
- The Software Architect Elevator ‚Äì Gregor Hohpe
- System Design Primer (GitHub)
- Clean Architecture ‚Äì Uncle Bob
